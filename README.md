This folder contains sample experimental videos obtained from the glass flume facility at IIT Madras, India. The experiments were conducted by Marshal Jins M, PhD scholar at IIT Madras, during the period 2024–2025 under the supervision of Dr. Vijay K. G., Assistant Professor at IIT Madras. It contains sample videos recorded during the experimental analysis of three different breakwaters —single, dual, and triple-chambered —tested under identical conditions. The testing parameters are as follows: a water depth of 40 cm, a wave height of 6 cm, a wave period of 2.2 seconds, and a constant structural porosity of 0.4 for all models.



The contents of this repository serve as supplementary material for the paper titled: "Experimental and numerical study on wave scattering and flow dynamics near breakwaters having porous barriers with a solid back wall – Supplementary Materials".
